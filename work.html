WORK

TIME SERIES
Over the course of this past summer, I developed and utilized a time series model through Facebook’s Prophet to forecast future foot traffic trends in retail stores based on past data points.

OCCUPY SOCIAL MEDIA
For a class project, I evaluated and analyzed the social media platform Quora in a thorough report. I discuss my findings and overall experience with the site.

ANOMALY DETECTION
Also at during my internship this past summer, I established an efficient anomaly detection model based on past forecasting errors to explain deviations in foot traffic.

RESEARCH PROJECT
For my independent study, with the support of a School of Information PhD student, I used machine learning to build and evaluate a model to distinguish between two subreddits. I analyzed two communities from Reddit, r/Christianity and r/Atheism. Analysis of the model reveals aspects of each community’s distinct characteristics, specifically their temperaments and tendencies.

INFOGRAPHICS?
I created two infographics on the topics of Information Overload and Information Literacy. In the infographics, I synthesize and arrange the information to present a compelling argument to a general audience.
