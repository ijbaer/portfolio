UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN · SCHOOL OF INFORMATION · ANN ARBOR, MI 48104
IJBAER@UMICH.EDU

I am a junior at the University of Michigan pursuing a B.S. in the School of Information with a minor in statistics. Within the School of Information—an interdisciplinary program at the intersection of technology, people, and business—I am on the Information Analysis track where we focus on building skills to identify and articulate questions that matter to stakeholders and then presenting our findings in a compelling way. 

On campus, I am involved with research through the School of Information, the American Cancer Society at UMich, and intramural sports.

The past two summers I have focused on building my data analysis skills through attending a study abroad data science program in Lisbon, Portugal as well as two data science internships at a Lisbon user marketing firm and a foot traffic analytics start-up in San Francisco.
